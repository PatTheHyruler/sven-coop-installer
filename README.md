# Sven Co-op map installer

This is a map installer for Sven Co-op, made by PatTheHyruler.

You can drag+drop a zip file (some other archives are also supported) onto the executable and it will attempt to install it. You can also drag+drop multiple archives at once.

Of course, if the archive is not a Sven Co-op map, that can cause problems (most likely just nothing will happen, but best be careful anyway), so I recommend not using random archives that are not meant to be Sven Co-op maps.


The program should find your Sven Co-op install location on its own (if you're on Windows), but if it can't find it, you can specify the location yourself.
