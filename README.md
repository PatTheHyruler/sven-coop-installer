# Sven Co-op map installer

This is a map installer for Sven Co-op.

You can drag+drop a zip file onto the executable and it will attempt to install it.

Of course, if the zip file is not a Sven Co-op map, that can cause problems, so I recommend not using random zip files.
I also recommend not using any files other than zip files, because that won't work.



The program should find your Sven Co-op install location on its own (if you're on Windows), but if it can't find it, you can specify the location yourself.
